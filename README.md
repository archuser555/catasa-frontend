An Anonymous, Open source chat app, a mix between the modern Discord UI and the old Pidgin Ecosystem, focus on simplicity and anonymousity, you can say it's a modern Omegle with a better UI and with more freedom, no data stored, nothing is send to any database, just you talking to strangers and freinds, in a free, kinda-modern anonymous chat app!
